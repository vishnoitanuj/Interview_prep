# Notes
## Time Complexity Analysis
Big O 
A -> f(n)
if time taken by A for input n <= k*f(n)
### Insertion Sort
>* Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2)
>* Best Case Complexity: O(n)

### Selection Sort
>* Worst Case Complexity: O(n^2)
>* Best Case Complexity: O(n^2)

## Arrays
>* Whenever an integer array is created, all elements are initialised to 0.
>* Whenever an boolean array is created, all elements are initialised to false.
>* Whenever a double array is created, all elements are initialised to 0.0 .
